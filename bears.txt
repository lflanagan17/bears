# You start with n teddy bears (these will be given as an input from the user).
#  At each step of the game, a number of bears may be given away based on the the following rules...

# 1) If n is even, exactly n/2 bears may be given away
# 2) If n is divisible by 3 or 4, then the number of bears
# from multiplying the last two digits may be given away...
# exactly (n%10) * ((n%100)/10) bears may be given away
#  (there is an edge case here where we skip the rule if the number to be given away is 0)
# 3) If n is divisible by 5, then exactly 42 bears may be given away
# By following these rules, can you end with exactly 42 bears?




# Set Up Registers
# r14 - base pointer
# r15 - points to the top of the stacks
# r1 - instruction pointer; always holds n
# r2 - return value (holds 42)
# r3 - temp. to help compare values
# r4 - holds the value 2 to help with modular arithmetic
